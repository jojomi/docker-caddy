# I decided to disable telemetry completely in this image.
# If it would have been a simple CLI switch, I would have just put the switch to the CMD,
# but it seems I have to disable all metrics one by one. Caddy is a server and should behave
# as such, not as a client for whatever data collection (my opinion).
# Disable next line if you want to contribute to telemetry data collection.
